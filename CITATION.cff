abstract: >-
  reV (the Renewable Energy Potential model) is an open-source
  geospatial techno-economic tool that estimates renewable energy
  technical potential (capacity and generation), system cost, and
  supply curves for a variety of technologies, including but not
  limited to, geothermal (GT), pumped storage hydropower (PSH),
  solar photovoltaics (PV), concentrating solar power (CSP),
  wind energy, etc. reV allows researchers to include exhaustive
  spatial representation of the built and natural environment into
  the generation and cost estimates that it computes. reV is highly
  dynamic, allowing analysts to assess potential at varying levels
  of detail â€” from a single  site up to an entire continent at
  temporal resolutions ranging from five minutes to hourly, spanning
  a single year or multiple decades. The reV model can provide broad
  coverage across large spatial extents, including North America,
  South and Central Asia, the Middle East, South America, and
  South Africa to inform national and international-scale analyses.
  Still, reV is equally well-suited for regional infrastructure and
  deployment planning and analysis.
